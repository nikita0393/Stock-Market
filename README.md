### STOCK SPLIT 

-> The moment stock splits from 2 to 1 --> Face value halved --> number of shares doubles --> Market value halved (not necessarily half, can be any other value)

-> Therefore, stock splits --> Face value decreases --> number of shares increases proportionately --> Market value decreases proportionately.

> Example:

| | Original | Revised |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
FV | 2 | 1 |
Shares| 50000 | 100000 |
Value| 100000 | 100000 |


-> Value is intact
     
-> Stock splits so that Market price decreases and more people can buy the shares (increase liquidity). It's neither good nor bad.
