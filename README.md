-> LTCG - Long term capital gain : If a person holds a share for more than one year and earns a profit it is known as LTCG.

-> Dividend : Return on investment in shares.

> It's the company's decision whether to declare the dividend or not or it's not mandatory to give dividend unlike Interest.

-> Dividend and LTCG are tax free for individuals. 

> Subject to limits

> limit - 10,00,000 per year

-> Interest is given on Fixed deposits in banks

-> Promoter is a person who starts the company

> Promoter of Reliance company is Dhirubai Ambani.

> There can be multiple Promoters.

-> Share certificate includes Name of the shareholder, Face value (decided by the Promoters), Number of shares (Amount invested divided by the face value).

> Shareholders get a share certificate.

> In physical format or Demat format.

-> Demat - Dematerialized securities : For companies that are listed.

-> Annual Report : Report of the company.

> Gives information about number of physical or Dematerialized formats.

-> Face value can be different for different companies and is decided by the promoters of the company. 

-> a pvt ltd company converts to public ltd (or ltd) when there are more investors (or shareholders) other than the promoters.

-> pvt ltd company --> public ltd company --> listed company

-> Turnover is basically Sales

-> Profit before Tax = turnover - expenses

-> Topline means Turnover

-> Bottomline means Profit after Tax

-> Usually profit increases with turnover. But Profit might decrease even with increase in Turnover when expenses increase out of proportion.

### STOCK SPLIT 

- The moment stock splits from 2 to 1 --> Face value halved --> number of shares doubles --> Market value halved (not necessarily half, can be any other value)

- Therefore, stock splits --> Face value decreases --> number of shares increases proportionately --> Market value decreases proportionately.

> Example:

| | Original | Revised |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
FV | 2 | 1 |
Shares| 50000 | 100000 |
Value| 100000 | 100000 |


- Value is intact
     
- Stock splits so that Market price decreases and more people can buy the shares (increase liquidity). It's neither good nor bad.

### LTP: Last Traded Price 
- Price at which share is traded at the end

- LTP can keep changing during the business hours 

-> 9:15 to 9:30 - huge fluctuations in the market due to sudden increase in buys or sudden increase in sells.

### Preopening market session - 9:00 to 9:15
- A 15 minute session to absorb heavy fluctuations in the market.

- To absorb the volatility which would arise if trading directly starts at 9:15

- 9:00 to 9:07 - buy or sell

- 9:08 to 9:11 - Matching

- Can buy or sell

- Helps the small investors to guess the trend when the market opens at 9:15

### After market hours - 4:00pm to 9:00am 
- Orders placed in this hour are called After market orders (AMO)

- For people who work during day hours.

- We may place AMOs but they will get executed at 9:15am.

-> Closing price will not necessarily be equal to Opening price because of AMOs

### Gap Up Opening
- If the share price opens at a price higher than previous days closing price, it is known as Gap up opening. It is represented by a green upwards triangle.

### Gap Down Opening
- If the share price opens at a price lower than previoud day's closing price, it is known as Gap down opening. It is represented by a red downwards triangle.

> Bid price means best buy price

> 26 bid quantity means that number of buy orders is 26.

-> Sell price 
> Best selling price

-> Volume
> Number of shares that were traded during the day.

> If 100 sold and 100 bought --> Volume is 100 and not 200

-> Today's low and high
> Today's lowest and highest price of the company

-> 52 wk low/high
> 1 year's lowest and highest price.

-> Therefore price can be different for BSE and NSE due to change in demand and supply.
